üß¨ CypherMed ‚Äî Blockchain-Based Medicine Authentication and QC Verification
Overview

CypherMed is a decentralized medicine authentication platform that prevents counterfeit drugs and ensures product quality through end-to-end blockchain tracking.
Every medicine batch passes through four main stakeholders:

Manufacturer ‚Äì Adds product data

QC Authority (Government / Lab) ‚Äì Uploads Quality Certificate (QC)

Retailer / Distributor ‚Äì Verifies authenticity

Customer ‚Äì Scans and verifies before purchase

Each product‚Äôs details are hashed using SHA-256 with dynamic salt, stored on the Polygon Amoy testnet, and linked with its IPFS CID for decentralized storage.
For visual traceability, the hash is invisibly embedded as a digital watermark in the product image using DCT-DWT-based watermarking.

Tech Stack

Workflow Summary
1. Manufacturer ‚Äî Add Product

Enters product details (ID, Name, Expiry, Batch No).

Backend generates:

SHA-256 hash (with salt)

DCT-DWT invisible watermark

IPFS CID for image or metadata

Hash and CID are stored on Polygon Amoy using the storeHash() function.

2. QC Uploader ‚Äî Upload Quality Certificate

Government or lab official uploads test report or QC PDF.

File is uploaded to IPFS, and CID is linked to the product hash on blockchain.

3. Retailer / Distributor

Scans QR code or enters product hash.

Retrieves verification status:

‚úÖ Not Counterfeited (hash found on chain)

‚ùå Counterfeited (not found)

4. Customer

Verifies authenticity through the Flutter app.

Can view product details, QC reports (via IPFS), and blockchain transaction info.

Backend (FastAPI)
Main Endpoints

/add_product ‚Äî Generates hash, uploads metadata, and stores hash on Polygon

/verify_product ‚Äî Verifies if hash exists on blockchain

/show_details ‚Äî Fetches product info from blockchain/IPFS

/add_qc ‚Äî Uploads QC file to IPFS and links to product hash

/view_qc ‚Äî Retrieves QC report using IPFS CID

Blockchain Functions (Solidity)

storeHash(dataHash, cid) ‚Äî Stores hash and IPFS CID

verifyProduct(dataHash) ‚Äî Verifies product authenticity

getProductByHash(dataHash) ‚Äî Retrieves stored product details

addQC(dataHash, qcCID) ‚Äî Links QC document to product

getQC(dataHash) ‚Äî Retrieves QC document CID

Watermarking Module (Python)
Algorithm

Convert image to YCbCr and apply Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

Apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).

Embed the SHA-256 hash bits as watermark in the mid-frequency band.

Reconstruct the image and save to /watermarked_images/.

Detection

Extract watermark bits using inverse DWT and DCT.

Compare extracted hash with on-chain hash.
If any tampering occurs, the extracted code will not match.

React Admin Dashboard

Located inside ReactApp/frontend/.

Modules

Product Upload (Manufacturer)

QC Upload (Government / Lab)

Verification Dashboard (On-chain and IPFS data)

Analytics Page (Verified / Counterfeit counts)

To run locally:

cd ReactApp/frontend
npm install
npm start

IPFS + Blockchain Integration

All product metadata (JSON, images, certificates) are uploaded to IPFS.
Only the IPFS CID and SHA-256 hash are stored on Polygon to minimize gas fees.

Example metadata:

{
  "product_id": "CM1234",
  "hash": "0xa8d3c5...",
  "ipfs_cid": "QmXT7fP...",
  "qc_cid": "QmYh9zD..."
}
